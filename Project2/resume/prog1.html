	<p> Using flow sensor and solenoid valve the water is monitored and controlled by sending and receiving the message using GSM module and the leakage of water is detected by the leakage detector.

		<li> The geopolitics of water management in the Middle East are primarily governed by the basic distribution of freshwater resources: there are vast differences between the naturally available water resources in the region.</li><br>

		<li>  Layer to this the additional complexity of political stability, financial assets, and other socioeconomic factors, and the potential for improved transboundary water management in the Middle East becomes vastly complicated.</li><br>

		<li> Simply, some nations have few water resources and a lack of capabilities to effectively manage their limited resources â€“ their water security is at risk. Other nations, those with more technological and economic capacity to maximize their limited resources, have less at stake.</li><br>

		<li> Our recent trip to the Middle East in February underscored the well-known perspective that while Israel is making great advances in water management in the region, Palestine and Jordan are simply further behind.</li>
